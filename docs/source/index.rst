MCPROT, A small project I have been working on.
==================================

   This is another Minecraft packet protocol handler, designed because quarry wasn't working out for me.
   At the time, I needed a challenge and I was very interested in the Minecraft protocol.
   Rather than using an existing client library, I decided to create my own to expand my knowledge in this field.


What is this project?
---------------------------------

   This is a project that I have been working on since August of 2021.
   I do not intend on making this into an actual client library because I haven't got the time.
   Along with that, there are already plenty, much better client libraries out there.
   Feel free to fork the project and edit it to your liking as long as you do not violate the license put on this repository.
